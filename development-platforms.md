# Development Platforms

We're going to need easy ways to help people get up and running.  To start with we're aiming for vagrant boxes to help with quick development setup ([joepferguson](https://www.github.com/svpernova09) is in charge). We'll also need windows boxes, and possibly some different virtual backends (parallels, hyper-v, vmware) for the php7dev box beyond virtualbox

Below is a list of development environments that can be used to build PHP 7 and test extensions.

* [Rasmus' PHP 7 Dev Box](https://github.com/rlerdorf/php7dev) - actually contains all versions of PHP and easy ways to switch, update and recompile them.
* [Windows 7 for compiling PHP 7](https://github.com/svpernova09/Windows7-php7dev)
* [PHPBrew](http://phpbrew.github.io/phpbrew/) - PHP CLI application to easily install various versions of PHP including master branch.

Other sources of PHP 7:

* [Zend's nightly PHP7 builds for Debian and CentOS](http://php7.zend.com)
